CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

Based on preliminary codebase analysis:

1. Encryption Implementation Missing (CRITICAL)
   Location: server/services/TipService.ts:107-114
   Risk: Messages stored in plaintext
   Fix: Implement AES-256-GCM with random IV

2. Private Key in Configuration (CRITICAL)
   Location: server/config.ts:66, BlockchainService.ts:139
   Risk: Keys exposed if .env leaks
   Fix: Use AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, or HashiCorp Vault

3. No Signature Verification (CRITICAL)
   Location: server/services/BlockchainService.ts:157-177
   Risk: Anyone can submit transactions
   Fix: Implement EIP-191/EIP-712 verification

4. No Nonce Tracking (CRITICAL)
   Location: Entire codebase (missing)
   Risk: Replay attacks possible
   Fix: Implement nonce tracking in database

5. No Rate Limiting (CRITICAL)
   Location: server/index.ts:36
   Risk: DoS attacks, relayer wallet drain
   Fix: Implement Redis-based rate limiting

All 5 critical issues have complete fixes in verytippers_critical_patterns.md
